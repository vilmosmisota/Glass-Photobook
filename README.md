# Glass - Photobook | Coming soon page

This is a coming soon page for a client who is publishing a photobook in the near future. The goal is to collect subscribers and give a brief of what is coming.

## Overview

The client wanted a **simple one-page website** that introduces the project and collects subscribers. I didn't want to overkill the project with frameworks, so I picked the good old **HTML, CSS and Javascript** combination for this project *(The official website which will sell the book is using Next Js and Stripe Api)*.\  
To collect subscribers, I used the **Mailchimp** form service to match the budget of the project.\
To spice up the look of the page I implemented some scroll animation with the help of **Intersection-observer Api**.\
